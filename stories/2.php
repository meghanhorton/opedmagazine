		<h1>Hamill: Dylan Farrow&#39;s child molestation claims against Woody Allen were planted by Mia Farrow</h1>

		<h3>From NY Daily News</h3>

		<h3>By Denis Hamill</h3>

		<h4 class="first"><em>The &#39;Manhattan Murder Mystery&#39; director doesn&#39;t fit the profile of a pedophile and asserts that the allegations are a part of his ex-lover&#39;s angry campaign against him.</em></h4>

		<p>I don&#39;t believe&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Woody+Allen">Woody Allen</a> is a child molester.</p>

		<p><a class="highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#1">But when I read Dylan Farrow&#39;s letter in The New York Times accusing her adoptive father of sexual abuse, I didn&#39;t think she was making it up.
			I believe it&#39;s a scenario she&#39;s come to believe after it was implanted in her impressionistic head as a kid.</a></p>

		<p>On March 18, 1993, after a Connecticut prosecutor declined to charge Allen after a three-month investigation of the same allegations, I interviewed him at his Fifth Ave.
			apartment.</p>

		<p>Soon Yi Previn, then his girlfriend and now his wife and mother of their two adopted children, answered the door.
			I sat with Allen in his living room.
			Previn excused herself.</p>

		<p>I asked Allen about the effect of the charges on his relationship with his kids.</p>

		<p>&quot;In the past eight months, I haven&#39;t seen Dylan once, and I have spent a grand total of 36 hours with Satchel, my biological son,&quot; he said.
			&quot;And those visits are just two hours a week.
			Supervised.
			They are intense because you try to jam-pack a whole week into that time.
			You rush from toy to toy and you have to brush past the things he says.
			Things like, &#39;I&#39;m supposed to say I hate you.&#39; And, &#39;Mommy is writing a book that she says will make you go away forever.&#39; Or, &#39;We&#39;re getting a new daddy&#39; and, &#39;I wish you were dead.&#39; He would say these things but not act them.
			It was as if he were obliged to say them.
			It was hard.&quot;</p>

		<p>What would he say to the child?</p>

		<p>&quot;I would tell him that me and his mommy had a fight.
			But that it would be over soon.
			I always made sure to tell him that his mommy is pretty and a wonderful actress ...
			I would change the subject, and we would go bake cookies, play with clay, show him a new toy.
			But every time I would start to feel bad I would remind myself that Dylan wasn&#39;t here and wonder how she was at that moment.
			Was she wondering why Satch could see me but not her? How confused can one kid become? And then I would have to refocus on Satchel,&quot; who now goes by Ronan.</p>

		<p>I asked about the finding by a team of child abuse specialists from Yale-New Haven Hospital that Dylan had not been molested.</p>

		<p>&quot;The greatest feeling that came out of today&#39;s meeting at Yale was when the verifiers told me that I should see Dylan as soon as possible because she loves me and misses me,&quot; he said.
			&quot;It brings me great joy, but at the same time, deep sadness.
			Because if she still loves me, I can&#39;t imagine how confused she is about my not seeing her.
			It will take a long, long time to answer all her questions.&quot;</p>

		<p>Allen paused when he was asked about Farrow.</p>

		<p><a class="highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#2">&quot;You would think any mother would be relieved that a three-member panel, two of them women, found that her daughter had not been molested,&quot; Allen said.
			&quot;But so deep is her venom that she actually sees this as a loss.
			That is terribly sad.
			She knows I never molested Dylan.&rdquo;</a></p>

		<p>I interviewed Woody Allen several times before and since that story.
			The press-shy writer-actor-director talks to me for a couple of reasons.
			One, my brother Brian had worked as a still photographer on many of his classic movies including &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; &quot;Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Bullets Over Broadway.&quot; Another is that we had a working-class Brooklyn connection.</p>

		<p>Allen and Farrow lived on opposite sides of Central Park.
			Allen told me he never once spent the night at Farrow&#39;s place.
			But after their romance ended, according to Allen, he&#39;d occasionally ask Farrow to Knicks games.
			When she declined, Allen said, she asked him to take her adopted daughter Soon Yi Previn, with whom Allen said he&#39;d rarely spoken.</p>

		<p>He took her.</p>

		<p>Previn was 20, Allen, 56.
			They fell in love.
			&quot;The heart wants what it wants,&quot; was Allen&#39;s explanation.</p>

		<p>A May-December romance blossomed, similar to the once Farrow and Frank Sinatra once enjoyed.</p>

		<p><a class="highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#3">When Farrow found out, she launched an enraged public campaign against Allen.</a></p>

		<p><a class="highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#3">Then Farrow accused Allen of molesting their daughter Dylan, then 7, in an attic in Connecticut.
			A three-month investigation ended with the charges deemed unfounded by the Yale-New Haven team.
			The Connecticut prosecutor said &nbsp;he thought there was probable cause to believe Allen molested Dylan, but he declined to press charges.</a></p>

		<p>Here&#39;s my problem with believing the story Dylan Farrow now tells: <a class="highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#4">I&#39;m no shrink but I&#39;ve often written about pedophilia and leading experts tell me the first time a pedophile is caught he&#39;s usually abused an average of 13 children.
			Pedophilia is not a passing experiment.</a></p>

		<p>But in the 56 years before Farrow&#39;s initial accusations and in the 21 years since, there has never been another accusation of Woody Allen molesting another child.</p>

		<p>What he told me back in 1993 remains true today.</p>

		<p>&quot;The burden of guilt is on you, not on the accusers,&quot; he said.
			&quot;This is on me like a tattoo for life.
			There will always be some people who believe what I was accused of just because I was accused.&quot;</p>

		<p><a class="highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#5">Again, I&#39;m not an expert but I don&#39;t think Woody Allen is a child molester.</a></p>

		<p><a class="highlight" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#5">I also don&#39;t think Dylan Farrow believes she&#39;s telling a lie.</a></p>

I believe it\'s a scenario she\'s come to believe after it was implanted in her impressionistic head as a kid.</h3>
		      	<p>The motive for taking these accusations public is unclear. She is not suing Allen, so the accusations do not directly benefit her or her family. On the other hand, Farrow did relinquish her privacy when she made the accusations public so she must be certain that the accusations are true.</p>';
    $modal[2] = '<h3 class="wrong-assumption">"You would think any mother would be relieved that a three-member panel, two of them women, found that her daughter had not been molested," Allen said. "But so deep is her venom that she actually sees this as a loss. That is terribly sad. She knows I never molested Dylan.‚Äù</h3>
		      	<p>No mother would be disappointed that her daughter was not molested. Mia Farrow must truly believe or have some kind of evidence that this abuse occurred. Mother and daughter Farrow could not hate Allen that much to raise false accusations of child abuse. There are many other damaging things Mia Farrow could throw at Allen that are true. Just look at his marriage with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn who is 36 years his junior.</p>';
    $modal[3] = '<h3 class="wrong-assumption">When Farrow found out, she launched an enraged public campaign against Allen.

Then Farrow accused Allen of molesting their daughter Dylan, then 7, in an attic in Connecticut. A three-month investigation ended with the charges deemed unfounded by the Yale-New Haven team. The Connecticut prosecutor said  he thought there was probable cause to believe Allen molested Dylan, but he declined to press charges.</h3>
		      	<p>Farrow probably said a few nasty things about Allen when he dated her adopted daughter after they broke up. But writing that Farrow "launched an enraged public campaign" is a little hyperbolic. The writer is an acquaintance of Allen and tries to paint Farrow as an emotional and deranged woman. </p>
		      	<p>It is interesting that Allen was cleared of these charges many years ago even though one prosecutor thought he may not be entirely innocent. But because he was officially dismissed of the charges they should not be brought up again unless there is new evidence.</p>';
    $modal[4] = '<h3 class="wrong-assumption">I\'m no shrink but I\'ve often written about pedophilia and leading experts tell me the first time a pedophile is 
caught he\'s usually abused an average of 13 children. Pedophilia is not a passing experiment.</h3>
    			<p>Each pedophile starts with one case so Farrow could be the first case. It\'s also very common for people to keep silent about abuse to avoid reliving it. People that experience abuse as a child may try to repress that memory as well so that could be why no one has brought forth any other accusations against Allen. The writer does not say which experts claim that pedophiles abuse an average of 13 children so that validity of that statement is questionable.</p>';
    $modal[5] = '<h3 class="wrong-assumption">Again, I\'m not an expert but I don\'t think Woody Allen is a child molester. I also don\'t think Dylan Farrow believes she\'s telling a lie.</h3>
    			<p>The writer insinuates that Farrow had a false event implanted in her memory. These means that he accuses Mia Farrow of creating this scenario in order to get back her Allen. Farrow would have to be willing to sacrifice her daughter to get back at an ex. Why would she do this?</p>';
